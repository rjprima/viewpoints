# FrameWalk

An app designed to help you find inspiration and never run out of things to photograph, all while taking relaxing walks through your community.

## Goals

Users will be able to explore their surrounding area and find inspiration in their environment through photography prompts along routes/locations around the University of Washington, Seattle, campus.

Whether a user’s list of ideas has met its end or has struggled to even start, lack of inspiration can demotivate, kill consistency, and vice versa. We don’t want users to be stuck wishing they could be more creative and feeling like they need a lucky epiphany instead of a reliable source to offer an aesthetic vision.

Since people have their typical routes around school, work, and their general neighborhood, new places and scenery lie waiting to be discovered. Offering users a new, specific path with curated photo prompts will let them literally see the space through a new lens.
As the seasons change, we want users to reflect on a detailed catalog of their exploration and personal perspective along with their ever-changing environment.

## Android Setup and Google Maps Configuration

This guide walks you through running FrameWalk on an Android emulator with a working Google Maps view, on either **macOS** or **Windows**. Every teammate sets up their own Google Maps API key. Keys are never shared or committed.

Quick facts about how this project is configured:

| Setting | Value | Where it's defined |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flutter project root | `FrameWalk/frame_walk/` | folder containing `pubspec.yaml` |
| Android application ID (package name) | `com.frame_walk.app` | `frame_walk/android/app/build.gradle.kts` |
| Maps plugin | `google_maps_flutter` | `frame_walk/pubspec.yaml` |
| Where your API key goes | `MAPS_API_KEY=...` in `frame_walk/android/local.properties` | not committed (ignored by `frame_walk/android/.gitignore`) |
| How the key reaches the app | `build.gradle.kts` reads `MAPS_API_KEY` from `local.properties` and passes it to `AndroidManifest.xml` as `${MAPS_API_KEY}` | `frame_walk/android/app/build.gradle.kts`, `frame_walk/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` |

> **Commands:** when macOS and Windows differ, both are shown. Mac commands are for the **Terminal** app; Windows commands are for **PowerShell**. Commands that are the same on both are shown once.

### 1. Prerequisites

#### 1.1 Install Flutter (includes Dart)

Dart comes bundled with Flutter, so you don't install it separately. The project requires Dart `^3.13.5` (see `pubspec.yaml`), so use a current **stable** Flutter release. The project was set up with Flutter 3.47.8.

1. Follow the official install guide for your OS and choose **Android** as the target platform:
   - macOS: <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos>
   - Windows: <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows>
2. Make sure the `flutter` command is on your `PATH`. Close and reopen your terminal, then run:

   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```

   You should see `channel stable` and a Dart version of 3.13.5 or newer. If not, run `flutter upgrade`.

#### 1.2 Install Android Studio

1. Download and install Android Studio from <https://developer.android.com/studio>.
2. Open it and complete the **Setup Wizard** using the **Standard** install type. This installs the Android SDK, Android Emulator, and a bundled Java runtime (JDK). You don't need to install Java separately.
3. Open the SDK Manager:
   - **macOS:** **Android Studio > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Android SDK**
   - **Windows:** **File > Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Android SDK**

   (From the Welcome screen: **More Actions > SDK Manager**.)
4. On the **SDK Tools** tab, make sure these are checked, then click **Apply**:
   - Android SDK Build-Tools
   - **Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)** (`flutter doctor` needs this)
   - Android Emulator
   - Android SDK Platform-Tools

#### 1.3 Install the Flutter and Dart plugins in Android Studio

1. Open the Plugins settings:
   - **macOS:** **Android Studio > Settings > Plugins**
   - **Windows:** **File > Settings > Plugins**
2. On the **Marketplace** tab, search for **Flutter** and click **Install**. Accept when it offers to install **Dart** too.
3. Restart Android Studio.

#### 1.4 Create an Android emulator

1. In Android Studio, open **Device Manager**: **View > Tool Windows > Device Manager**, or **More Actions > Virtual Device Manager** on the Welcome screen.
2. Click **+** (Create Virtual Device) and pick a phone, such as **Pixel 8**, then click **Next**.
3. Pick a system image. **This step matters for Google Maps:**
   - Choose an image whose **Services** column says **Google Play** (preferred) or **Google APIs**.
   - Do **not** choose a plain "Android Open Source" image. Those have no Google Play Services, and the map will not load.
   - **Mac with Apple silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):** choose an **arm64-v8a** image.
   - **Windows and Intel Macs:** choose an **x86_64** image.
   - Download a recent API level, for example the latest one marked "Recommended".
4. Click **Next**, then **Finish**. Press **▶** next to the device to start it once and confirm it boots.

**Windows only, if the emulator won't start or is extremely slow:** the emulator needs hardware virtualization.

- Make sure virtualization (Intel VT-x / AMD-V / SVM) is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI settings.
- In SDK Manager > SDK Tools, install **Android Emulator hypervisor driver (installer)**, *or* turn on **Windows Hypervisor Platform** under **Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows features on or off**, then restart.

**macOS:** no extra virtualization setup is needed.

#### 1.5 Verify with `flutter doctor`

1. Accept the Android SDK licenses (type `y` for each):

   ```bash
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   ```

2. Run the doctor:

   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

3. For this project you need green checkmarks for **Flutter**, **Android toolchain**, and **Android Studio**. Warnings about Xcode, Chrome, or Visual Studio are fine to ignore; we're only targeting Android here.

### 2. Getting the Project Running

#### 2.1 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rjprima/FrameWalk.git
```

(If you've set up SSH keys with GitHub, you can use `git@github.com:rjprima/FrameWalk.git` instead.)

#### 2.2 Open the correct folder in Android Studio

The Flutter project lives in the **`frame_walk`** subfolder, not the top-level `FrameWalk` folder.

1. In Android Studio choose **File > Open** (or **Open** on the Welcome screen).
2. Select **`FrameWalk/frame_walk`** (the folder that contains `pubspec.yaml`) and click **Open**.
   - Don't open `FrameWalk/` (the repo root) or `FrameWalk/frame_walk/android/`. Android Studio won't recognize them as a Flutter project.
3. If Android Studio asks for the Flutter SDK path, point it to the folder where you installed Flutter.

#### 2.3 Install dependencies

From a terminal in the `frame_walk` folder (Android Studio has one built in under **View > Tool Windows > Terminal**):

macOS:

```bash
cd FrameWalk/frame_walk
flutter pub get
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd FrameWalk\frame_walk
flutter pub get
```

#### 2.4 Build once to generate local files

Run one debug build. It doesn't need an API key yet. It creates three files that are intentionally **not** in Git and are needed in later steps:

- `android/local.properties` (holds your SDK paths, and later your API key)
- `android/gradlew` / `android/gradlew.bat` (the Gradle wrapper scripts)
- your personal debug signing key (`.android/debug.keystore` in your home folder)

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

The first build downloads Gradle and other dependencies and can take several minutes.

#### 2.5 Pick an emulator and run the app

1. Start your emulator from **Device Manager** (▶), or from the terminal:

   ```bash
   flutter emulators
   flutter emulators --launch <emulator id from the list>
   ```

2. Confirm Flutter can see it:

   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```

   You should see something like `sdk gphone64 ... (mobile) • emulator-5554 • android-...`.
3. Run the app:
   - **Android Studio:** pick the emulator in the device dropdown in the top toolbar, make sure the run configuration is `main.dart`, and click **Run ▶**.
   - **Terminal:**

     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

     If more than one device is connected, use `flutter run -d emulator-5554` (with your device ID).

The app should open. **The Map tab will be blank until you finish Section 3.**

### 3. Google Maps API Setup

Each teammate creates their **own** API key tied to **their own** computer's debug signing certificate (SHA-1). This keeps keys out of GitHub and means one person's key can't break anyone else's setup.

#### 3.1 Create or select a Google Cloud project

1. Go to <https://console.cloud.google.com/> and sign in.
2. Click the project picker at the top of the page, then **New Project**.
3. Name it (for example `framewalk-yourname`), click **Create**, then make sure it's selected in the project picker.

#### 3.2 Enable billing

Google requires a billing account on any project that uses the Maps Platform, even for usage that's free.

1. Open **☰ Menu > Billing** and link or create a billing account for the project. New accounts are usually offered free-trial credit.
2. Check the current pricing at <https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/>. At the time of writing, map loads in the Maps SDK for Android don't incur charges, but confirm this yourself.
3. Recommended: under **Billing > Budgets & alerts**, create a small budget (e.g. $1) so you get an email if anything ever starts charging.

#### 3.3 Enable the Maps SDK for Android

1. Open **☰ Menu > APIs & Services > Library**.
2. Search for **Maps SDK for Android**, open it, and click **Enable**.

#### 3.4 Create an API key

1. Open **☰ Menu > APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. Click **+ Create credentials > API key**.
3. Copy the key (it starts with `AIza`) somewhere private for now. **Don't paste it into Slack, Discord, a text message, a Google Doc, or any file in the repo.**

#### 3.5 Find the project's Android package name

Our application ID is:

```text
com.frame_walk.app
```

You can confirm it in `frame_walk/android/app/build.gradle.kts` (look for `applicationId`). If that value is ever changed, everyone must update their key restriction to match.

#### 3.6 Get your debug SHA-1 fingerprint

Android signs debug builds with a debug keystore that's unique to **your** computer, so your SHA-1 is different from everyone else's. Complete step 2.4 first so that the keystore and the Gradle wrapper exist.

**Option A: Gradle wrapper `signingReport` (recommended)**

macOS:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew signingReport
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd android
.\gradlew.bat signingReport
```

The output is long. Find the block for **`Variant: debug`** under **`> Task :app:signingReport`** and copy the value after **`SHA1:`**. It looks like `AB:CD:12:...` (20 pairs separated by colons).

**Option B: `keytool`** (use this if Gradle complains that `JAVA_HOME` isn't set). These commands use the Java runtime bundled with Android Studio at its default install location:

macOS:

```bash
"/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin/keytool" -list -v \
  -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey \
  -storepass android -keypass android
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr\bin\keytool.exe" -list -v `
  -keystore "$env:USERPROFILE\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey `
  -storepass android -keypass android
```

Copy the line labelled **`SHA1:`**. (`android` is the standard, public password for every debug keystore. It is not a secret.)

#### 3.7 Restrict your API key

Restricting the key means that even if it leaked, it would only work for our app on your computer.

1. Go back to **APIs & Services > Credentials** and click your key's name.
2. Under **Application restrictions**, choose **Android apps**, then click **+ Add**:
   - **Package name:** `com.frame_walk.app`
   - **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:** the SHA-1 you copied in step 3.6
3. Under **API restrictions**, choose **Restrict key** and select only **Maps SDK for Android**.
4. Click **Save**. Changes can take a few minutes to take effect.

#### 3.8 Add the key to your local configuration

The project reads the key from **`frame_walk/android/local.properties`**. Don't put it anywhere else (not in `AndroidManifest.xml`, not in Dart code).

1. Open `frame_walk/android/local.properties`. Flutter created it in step 2.4, and it already contains lines like `sdk.dir=...` and `flutter.sdk=...`. **Leave those lines as they are.**
2. Add this line at the bottom, using your own key:

   ```properties
   MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaYourOwnKeyGoesHere
   ```

   - No quotes, no spaces inside the key, and the name must be exactly `MAPS_API_KEY`.
3. Save the file and fully rebuild. Hot reload/restart is **not** enough, because the key is baked in at build time:

   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter run
   ```

4. Open the **Map** tab. You should see a map centered on the UW campus.

### 4. API Key Security

**Where your key lives:** only in `frame_walk/android/local.properties` on your own computer. `frame_walk/android/.gitignore` contains `/local.properties`, so Git ignores it.

**Safe to commit** (the shared configuration; no secrets in them):

- `frame_walk/android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- `frame_walk/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (it only contains the placeholder `${MAPS_API_KEY}`, never a real key)
- `frame_walk/pubspec.yaml`, `frame_walk/pubspec.lock`

**Never commit:**

- `frame_walk/android/local.properties`
- anything containing a real key (text starting with `AIza`)
- keystores (`*.keystore`, `*.jks`) or `key.properties`

**Check before you push.** Run these from the `frame_walk` folder (they work on both macOS and Windows):

```bash
# Should print the .gitignore rule that ignores it. If it prints nothing, STOP and ask the team.
git check-ignore -v android/local.properties

# Should print nothing. Any output means a key is in a tracked file.
git grep -n "AIza"

# Review exactly what you're about to commit.
git status
git diff --staged
```

Never use `git add -f` on `local.properties`. If a key ever does get pushed, deleting the file isn't enough: go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**, **delete or regenerate** that key, and create a new one.

**One key per teammate:** each person uses their own Google Cloud key restricted to their own SHA-1. Your SHA-1 comes from your own debug keystore, so a teammate's key won't work on your machine (and shouldn't).

### 5. Troubleshooting

**`flutter doctor` reports missing dependencies**

- *"cmdline-tools component is missing"*: install **Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)** in SDK Manager (step 1.2).
- *"Android license status unknown"*: run `flutter doctor --android-licenses` and accept all.
- *"Unable to locate Android SDK"*: open Android Studio once to finish the Setup Wizard, or run `flutter config --android-sdk <path>`. The default SDK path is `~/Library/Android/sdk` on macOS and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk` on Windows.
- Run `flutter doctor -v` for full details.

**Emulator doesn't appear in `flutter devices`**

- Make sure the emulator has fully booted to the home screen, then run `flutter devices` again.
- Restart the connection with `adb kill-server` and then `adb devices`. If `adb` isn't found, it's in the SDK's `platform-tools` folder.
- Windows: if the emulator won't launch at all, see the virtualization notes in step 1.4.
- Make sure your system image matches your CPU: **arm64** on Apple-silicon Macs, **x86_64** on Windows and Intel Macs.

**Gradle build fails**

- *"flutter.sdk not set in local.properties"*: `android/local.properties` is missing or was created by hand. Delete it, run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter build apk --debug` to regenerate it, and re-add your `MAPS_API_KEY` line.
- *"Could not reserve enough space for object heap"* or the Gradle daemon crashing: `frame_walk/android/gradle.properties` gives Gradle up to 8 GB of memory (`-Xmx8G`). Close other apps and retry. If your computer has less RAM than that, tell the team rather than editing the shared file.
- *JDK / Java version errors*: Flutter should use the JDK bundled with Android Studio. Check which Java it's using with `flutter doctor -v`. If needed, run `flutter config --jdk-dir <path>`, using `/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home` on macOS or `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr` on Windows.
- *`./gradlew` or `.\gradlew.bat` not found*: the wrapper is gitignored and generated by Flutter. Run `flutter build apk --debug` once from `frame_walk` first.
- Anything else: run `flutter clean`, then `flutter pub get`, then try again.

**Map tab is blank or gray (UI loads but no map tiles)**

- Your system image may lack Google Play Services. Check that the emulator's image says **Google Play** or **Google APIs** (step 1.4).
- `MAPS_API_KEY` may be missing or misspelled in `android/local.properties`. The build still succeeds with no key, but the map stays blank.
- You may have edited `local.properties` without rebuilding. Run `flutter clean` and `flutter run`.
- The **Maps SDK for Android** may not be enabled, or billing may not be set up on your Google Cloud project (steps 3.2–3.3).
- The emulator may have no internet. Open Chrome in the emulator to check.

**API key authorization errors**

Watch the logs while you open the Map tab. Use the **Logcat** tool window in Android Studio, or the output of `flutter run`, and look for `Google Android Maps SDK` messages such as `Authorization failure` or `API key not found`.

- *`API key not found`*: the key isn't reaching the manifest. Recheck step 3.8.
- *`Authorization failure`*: the log usually prints the exact package name and SHA-1 your app is using, e.g. `Android Application (<cert_fingerprint>;<package_name>): XX:XX:...;com.frame_walk.app`. Compare both values with your key's restriction in Google Cloud.
- If you just changed key restrictions, wait about 5 minutes and try again.
- *"This API project is not authorized to use this API"*: enable **Maps SDK for Android** (step 3.3) and make sure the key's API restriction includes it.

**Wrong package name or SHA-1 fingerprint**

- The package name in your key restriction must be exactly `com.frame_walk.app`, with an underscore and no typos.
- The SHA-1 must be from **your** computer's debug keystore (step 3.6), not a teammate's. If you reinstall Android Studio or delete `~/.android` (`%USERPROFILE%\.android` on Windows), a new keystore is generated and you'll need to add the new SHA-1 to your key.
- Make sure you copied the **SHA-1** value, not SHA-256 or MD5.

**Missing local configuration files**

- `android/local.properties`, `android/gradlew`, and `android/gradlew.bat` are intentionally **not** in Git. A fresh clone won't have them. Run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter build apk --debug` from `frame_walk` to generate them, then add your `MAPS_API_KEY` line (step 3.8).
- Running `flutter clean` does **not** delete `local.properties`, so your key line stays.
